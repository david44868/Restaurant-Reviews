# Restaurant-Reviews
A restaurant review website I built for my Computer Science Capstone (for my Associate's degree). <br><br>

All users can look up restaurants using the search bar and the results would show the restaurant name, their logo, and their average rating. <br>
Upon clicking the restaurant, more information about the restaurant is given, such as their website link, their address, and reviews given by registered users. 
To give a review and a rating on a restaurant, a user must login or make an account. An admin account can delete user accounts and all registered users can update their profile information (name, email, password).

Languages used:
- HTML/CSS
- PHP
- SQL

A small-scale project that only has a few restaruants that were manually inputed in the database.
