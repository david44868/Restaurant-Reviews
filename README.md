# Restaurant-Reviews
A restaurant review website I built for my Computer Science Capstone (for my Associate's degree). <br>

Users can look up restaurants using the search bar and the results would show the restaurant name, their logo, and their rating.

Languages used:
- HTML/CSS
- PHP
- SQL

A small-scale project that only has a few restaruants that were manually inputed in the database.
