# Restaurant-Reviews
This is my first project and it is a restaurant review website I built for my Computer Science Capstone (for my Associate's degree). <br><br>

All users can look up restaurants using the search bar and the results would show the restaurant name, their logo, and their average rating. 
Upon clicking the restaurant, more information about the restaurant is given, such as their website link, their address, and reviews given by registered users. 
To give a review and a rating on a restaurant, a user must login or make an account. An admin account can delete user accounts and all registered users can update their profile information (name, email, password).

Languages used:
- HTML/CSS
- PHP
- SQL

A small-scale project that has a few restaruants that were manually inputed in the database. <br><br>
